Deviations: 
 - Issues with Firebase Package dependencies made it extremely difficult to compile the project and test the alpha.\
 - the grid size was reduced to 30 by 30, we played a real game and counted the width and height, neither exceeded 30.\
 - the grid has 2 rows of letters, F and O hard-coded in, this is just to test the drag and drop functionality
 - We did not include custom game features
 - the entry point is now the gameViewController, but this is temporary, it will be fixed by the presentation.
