Deviations: 
 - Issues with Firebase Package dependencies made it extremely difficult to compile the project and test the alpha.\
 - Aaron was very sick for the majority of this phase.
 - the grid size was reduced to 30 by 30, we played a real game and counted the width and height, neither exceeded 30.\
 - We did not include custom game features
